The information quality lab studies the science of science,
bibliographic information retrieval (especially retrieval and quality of
medical information), and how evidence-based arguments are used in
scholarship and in public discourse. The long-term goal of the lab’s
work is to develop computer support for debate and argumentation,
especially evidence synthesis. The lab’s technical perspective draws on
data science, argumentation, knowledge representation, computer
supported cooperative work, and human-computer interaction. Technical
skills commonly used in this lab include data science (machine learning,
network analysis, textmining), knowledge representation (ontologies and
semantic technologies), prototyping, annotation, mixed methods research,
and user-based evaluations. Typical applications areas include digital
libraries and health informatics.

Dr. Jodi Schneider is [Associate Professor of Information Sciences at the
University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/jodi-schneider), 
where she directs the Information Quality Lab. She studies the science of science 
through the lens of arguments, evidence, and persuasion. Her long-term research
agenda analyzes controversies applying science to public policy; how
knowledge brokers influence citizens; and whether controversies are
sustained by citizens’ disparate interpretations of scientific evidence
and its quality. She holds affiliate appointments in the Beckman
Institute, Health Care Engineering Systems Center, European Union
Center, Informatics, Center for Health Informatics, and Cline Center for
Advanced Social Research at the University of Illinois and the
Department of Psychiatry of the University of Illinois Chicago School of
Medicine. Her work has been funded by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation,
the European Commission, IMLS, NIH, Science Foundation Ireland, and an
NSF CAREER award.

Schneider completed her PhD in informatics at the National University of
Ireland ("Enabling reuse of arguments and opinions from online social
disputes"), Galway and has degrees in library & information science
(M.S. UIUC), mathematics (M.A. UT-Austin), and liberal arts (B.A., Great
Books, St. John's College).
