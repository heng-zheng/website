Do you help others understand technical and scientific information? 
Calling social media influencers, journalists, librarians, Wikipedia editors, activists, advocates, community leaders, and other knowledge brokers!

In 2023, we seek to interview 40 people who have provided information about COVID-19. Interviews are about 1 hour, by phone or on a video platform such as Zoom. 

In the interview, you will be asked a series of questions relating to:
* your experience finding and applying technical and scientific information
* how you distinguish between quality information, misleading information, and false information
* how you disseminate that information to your community and/or audience.

The purpose of this study is to understand how knowledge brokers assess the quality of technical and scientific information. Ultimately this study aims to develop a toolkit to help public libraries better serve the general public as well as knowledge brokers such as journalists, activists, advocates, Wikipedia editors, and community leaders. 

Interviewees will receive a $35 giftcard by email after the interview.
