permalink: /projects/risrs2020/activities
---
The project team will host a workshop to bring together diverse stakeholders to develop a series of research-informed outcomes (scientific workshops, policies, and industry tools) to reduce the citation and reuse of retracted publications.S ignificant pre-workshop activities will be undertaken (including literature review, citation analysis, stakeholder interviews and the writing and dissemination of stakeholder statements) which will seed the workshop themesand promote dynamic discussions that lead to an actionable agenda. The specific activities of the participating experts will be:

1. An interview to exploretheir professional experience with the retraction process and share their thoughts about how to address the circulation and citation of retracted science.
2. Attendance at a virtual workshop which will be a series of structured discussions over several days in October and November 2020.
3. The contribution of a discussion paper prior to the workshop which will be shared on this website to help inform the agenda setting activities.
4. A post-workshop outcomes survey.

Following the stakeholder workshop, PI Schneider will develop a consensus white paper with a coherent, actionable set of recommendations for next steps and disseminate the recommendations at select conferences. The goal is that these recommendations will lead to tangible plans for implementing next steps, in cooperation with industry partners within scientific publishing as well as government policymakers and academic institutions.
