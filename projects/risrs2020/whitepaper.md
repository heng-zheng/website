We look forward to your feedback to help shape the scope of the recommendations! <br/>

 <br/>

**Recommendations** <br/>
 <br/>
1. Prevent retractions from polluting the literature through the public availability of high- quality, consistent information about retractions.
2. Make retraction information easy to find and use by using clear and consistent display standards.
3. Recommend a taxonomy of retraction categories/classifications and corresponding retraction metadata that can be adopted by all stakeholders.
4. Develop best practices for coordinating the retraction process.
5. Educate stakeholders about retraction and pre- and post-publication stewardship of the scholarly record.

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY** <br/>
 <br/>
Retraction is a mechanism for alerting readers to unreliable material,
effectively removing from the published scientific and scholarly record
articles that are deemed to be unreliable or seriously flawed whether
due to misconduct or honest error. As noted in the Committee on
Publication Ethics (COPE) Retraction Guidelines, retractions may also be
used to address, “redundant publication, plagiarism, peer review
manipulation, reuse of material or data without authorisation, copyright
infringement or some other legal issue (e.g., libel, privacy,
illegality), unethical research, and/or a failure to disclose a major
competing interest that would have unduly influenced interpretations or
recommendations.” (COPE Council, 2019). Retracted papers insinuate
themselves into the scientific publication network via citations both
before and after retraction, which inadvertently propagates potentially
faked data, fundamental errors, and unreproducible results, or can lead
to misattribution of results or ideas (e.g., in cases of retraction due
to dual publication, plagiarism, or ownership). Research over the past
decade has identified a number of factors contributing to the
unintentional spread of retracted research. Many retracted papers are
not marked as retracted on publisher and aggregator sites, and retracted
articles may still be found in readers’ PDF libraries, including in
reference management systems such as Zotero, EndNote, and Mendeley. Most
publishers do not systematically surveil bibliographies of submitted
manuscripts, and most editors do not query whether a citation to a
retracted paper is justified. When citing retracted papers, authors
frequently do not indicate retraction status in bibliographies or
in-text citations. Collaboration across diverse stakeholders in the
academic publishing ecosystem is needed to reduce the inadvertent spread
of retracted science. This is a critical moment for stakeholder
dialogue: There is growing concern about the quality and reliability of
scientific and scholarly information both within the research enterprise
and in the broader public discourse; and the data needed to identify
retracted research has become available, particularly from the
Retraction Watch Database. 
 <br/>
The goal of the Reducing the Inadvertent
Spread of Retracted Science: Shaping a Research and Implementation
Agenda (RISRS) project is to develop an actionable agenda for reducing
the inadvertent spread of retracted science. This includes identifying
how the gatekeepers of scientific publications can monitor and
disseminate retraction status and determining what other actions are
feasible and relevant. Herein the term, paper, is used for the published
item that is retracted. We focus on whole, published items such as
journal articles, conference papers, book chapters, and monographs.
Except where otherwise stated, we exclude items that are posted as
opposed to published such as preprints or data deposits as well as
specific objects within a publication such as figures and images. The
RISRS process included an exploratory environment scan, a scoping review
of empirical literature, and successive rounds of stakeholder
consultation, culminating in a 3-part online workshop that brought
together a diverse body of 70 stakeholders to engage in collaborative
problem solving and dialogue. Workshop discussions were seeded by
materials derived from stakeholder interviews and short original
discussion pieces contributed by stakeholders. The online workshop
resulted in a set of recommendations to address the complexities of
retracted research throughout the scholarly communications ecosystem. 2
The recommendations below are being circulated for further refinement
with the aim of producing a final white paper in May 2021. The RISRS
team will continue to solicit feedback from across the scholarly
communications ecosystem, through presentations this spring to the
Society for Scholarly Publishing and other groups. We welcome your
feedback to refine the recommendations and the implementation agenda.
For instance, you might help form a professional working group to
further develop or refine these recommendations; present about
retraction and related issues at professional and academic meetings;
take on an implementation or policy project; or outline further research
to be conducted.
