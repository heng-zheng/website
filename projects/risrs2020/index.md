This project will bring together diverse stakeholders in the academic publishing ecosystem to interact, react, and reflect in real-time on the problems created by the continued citation of retracted research and, more importantly, on possible solutions. Attendees will include researchers, journal editors, research integrity officers, librarians, science writers, and other members of the academic publishing ecosystem. Enhanced collaboration among this diverse groups will address the challengesfaced and will develop a series of research-informed outcomes (scientific workshops, policies, and industry tools) designed to improve the scientific publishing industryâ€™s ability to manage the status of retracted scientific papersand reduce the citation and reuse of retracted publications in scientific publishing.
