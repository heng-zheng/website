From 2020-2022, the Reducing the Inadvertent Spread of Retracted Science: Shaping a Research and Implementation Agenda brought together diverse stakeholders in the academic publishing ecosystem to interact, react, and reflect in real-time on the problems created by the continued citation of retracted research and, more importantly, on possible solutions. Online attendees included researchers, journal editors, research integrity officers, librarians, science writers, and other members of the academic publishing ecosystem. Enhanced collaboration among this diverse groups addressed the challenges faced and developed [final recommendations](https://infoqualitylab.org/projects/risrs2020/whitepaper) and a series of research-informed [outcomes](https://infoqualitylab.org/projects/risrs2020/outputs) (scientific workshops, policies, and industry tools) designed to improve the scientific publishing industry’s ability to manage the status of retracted scientific papers and reduce the citation and reuse of retracted publications in scientific publishing. Since 2022, follow-up work is taking place in the [NISO Communication of Retractions, Removals, and Expressions of Concern Working Group](https://www.niso.org/standards-committees/crec).
