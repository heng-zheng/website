The Information Quality Lab studies how scientific evidence and arguments are disseminated. The lab's work is applied to evidence synthesis (in health, medicine, and environmental sciences), public understanding of science, digital libraries, and science of science. The lab takes a socio-technical perspective, concerned both with understanding current practices as well as developing computer support tools for information quality and for rational debate. The labâ€™s technical perspective draws on knowledge representation, computer supported cooperative work, and human-computer interaction. Technical skills commonly used in the lab include prototyping, annotation, web technologies (typically using semantic web standards such as ontologies), mixed methods research, and user-based evaluations.
