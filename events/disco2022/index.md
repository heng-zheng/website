---
The goal of the Digital Infrastructures for Scholarly Content Objects (DISCO2021) workshop at [JCDL 2021](https://2021.jcdl.org) is to raise awareness of quality issues and re-use challenges in digital infrastructures for scholarly content, and collect potential solutions among an audience of diverse expertise. The workshop will have two sessions.
- Session 1: 30 September 9am-12:15pm US CDT [convert to your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20210930T09&p1=5158&ah=3&am=15)
- Session 2: 30 September 6pm-9:15pm US CDT [convert to your timezone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20210930T18&p1=5158&ah=3&am=15)

## Problem Statement
As digital libraries make the dissemination of research publications
easier, they also enable the propagation of invalid or unreliable
knowledge. Examples of relevant problems include: retraction and
unknowing/unintentional citation and reuse of retracted papers;
propagation of errors in literature and scientific databases;
non-reproducible papers; known domain-specific issues such as cell line
contamination; bias in research datasets and publications; systematic
reviews that come up with different conclusions for the same problem at
the same time. In the digital environment, which facilitates broad
interdisciplinary reuse beyond the originating scientific community,
marking known problems and tracing the impact on dependent and follow-on
works is an important, but under-addressed problem. Further,
context-specific information inside a paper may not be immediately
reusable when extracted by automated processes, leading to apparent
contradictions. Current mitigating approaches use the underlying
reasoning for information retrieval, develop new infrastructures
analyzing the reasoning or certainty of statements, or use visualization
to highlight possible discrepancies.

## Intended Audience
DISCO's expected audience includes digital publishing and digital
library practitioners and researchers. The workshop may be of particular
interest to  researchers in semantic publishing, information quality,
provenance, trust, workflows, text mining, database curation, and
knowledge graphs. Users of digital infrastructures may also contribute,
particularly domain researchers in evidence synthesis communities,
innovators in open science, robustness and reproducibility, and those
helping researchers organize, find, and use scholary literature.

## Topics of Interest
-	Fact checking and knowledge updates for scholarly publishing, scholarly databases, and expert knowledge
-	“Living” documents and innovation in publishing
-	Semantic publishing, metadata, ontologies
-	Scholarly database curation, scholarly knowledge graphs
-	Argumentation, identifying and tracing dependencies between papers
-	Infrastructure for robustness and reproducibility (e.g.,  multiverse analyses, data storage and citation, etc.)
-	Infrastructure for knowledge and evidence synthesis, systematic review, question answering on expert knowledge
-	Annotation and integration of scholarly content
-	Quality assurance and quality assessment of automatic knowledge mining processes, recovering from retracted, outdated, or inconsistent findings
