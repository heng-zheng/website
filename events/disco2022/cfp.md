We invite original research papers (long) describing new developments,
innovative solutions, and practical experiences in the field of digital
infrastructures dedicated to handling scholarly content. Moreover, we
invite position papers (short) focusing on current challenges, possible
game changing technologies, and also surprising negative results as
interesting starting points for discussion.

* “Living” documents and innovation in publishing
* Semantic publishing, metadata, ontologies
* Scholarly database curation and scholarly knowledge graphs

* Infrastructure for robustness and reproducibility (e.g., multiverse analyses, data storage and citation, etc.)
* Infrastructure for knowledge and evidence synthesis, systematic review, question answering on expert knowledge
* Annotation and integration of scholarly content

### Submission Information
Submissions must be original and not submitted for publication
elsewhere. Since reviewing is not double-blind, submissions do not need
to be anonymized. At least 2 Program Committee members will review each
submission.

The maximum length of submissions (including bibliography) should be as
follows:  
Full paper submissions: 10 pages  
Position paper submissions: 5 pages
**Non-archival extended abstract**: 2 pages + reference

For non-archival extended abstract, submissions may include previously published results, late-breaking results, and work in progress. Extended abstracts can summarize existing work, work in progress, or a collection of works under a unified theme (e.g., a series of closely related papers that build on each other or tackle a common problem). Abstracts will be lightly reviewed to ensure that the topic is within the scope of the workshop. Accepted abstracts will be announced by June 10th. The abstracts are non-archival and will not appear in the formal CEUR workshop proceedings; participants are free to also submit their work for publication elsewhere. Figures and tables count toward the 2-page + references maximum length. 

All submissions must be in English, in PDF format. Papers should follow
two-column [CEUR-ART paper formatting guidelines](https://ceurws.wordpress.com/2020/03/31/ceurws-publishes-ceurart-paper-
style/). You can also download an [offline version with the style files containing both LaTeX and MS
Word templates](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip).

All papers are to be submitted via the conference’s EasyChair submission
system https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=disco2022

Each accepted paper must be presented online by at least one of the
co-authors. Accepted papers will be published in CEUR Workshop
Proceedings [http://ceur-ws.org/](http://ceur-ws.org/) as open access under a Creative
Commons Attribution (CC-BY 4.0) license. Authors of accepted papers will
need to sign a license agreement at the camera-ready stage.
