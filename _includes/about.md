The information quality lab studies the science of science, bibliographic information retrieval (especially retrieval and quality of medical information), and how evidence-based arguments are used in scholarship and in public discourse. The long-term goal of the lab’s work is to develop computer support for debate and argumentation, especially evidence synthesis. The lab’s technical perspective draws on data science, argumentation, knowledge representation, computer supported cooperative work, and human-computer interaction. Technical skills commonly used in this lab include data science (machine learning, network analysis, textmining), knowledge representation (ontologies and semantic technologies), prototyping, annotation, mixed methods research, and user-based evaluations. Typical applications areas include digital libraries and health informatics.
